## Project Title:

## Project Team : Amirali Omidfar, Hannaneh Hojaiji, Haisong Lin

###  What are you trying to do in your project? What kind of AI is involved? How is it interactive with users? What domain-specific problems does it solve?

### What is your proposed approach? Describe the planned system architecture, algorithms etc. Take as much space as needed, and include figures if necessary.


### What if anything have you done thus far towards the project? This can include literature search (in which case provide a list of relevant websites, articles, papers etc. that you have identified).


### What are the metrics of success/failure for your project?


### What items do you need or plan to use beyond Hexiwear, RPiZW, Smartphone, and Laptop? Please note that irrespective of whether the item is purchased by me, by you, or is already here with me or you, the total pre-tax/pre-shipping cost of all items must not exceed $25 * # of students in the team. It is okay if you donâ€™t yet know everything that you would need, but describe to the best of your ability.

# Bake-Off 2
## Project Title:
### Explainable CamIoT
## Project Team : Amirali Omidfar, Hannaneh Hojaiji, Haisong Lin

###  What are you trying to do in your project? What kind of AI is involved? How is it interactive with users? What domain-specific problems does it solve?
*** Our goal is to improve camIoT behavior in three different phase :***
1. Triggering mechanism
2. Object deteciton 
3. Finger control

### What is your proposed approach? Describe the planned system architecture, algorithms etc. Take as much space as needed, and include figures if necessary.
*** We are aiming to use to rule extraction in modeling the behavior of user performed triggering mechanism and give feedback in such way that user would improve his/her triggering action in later rounds.

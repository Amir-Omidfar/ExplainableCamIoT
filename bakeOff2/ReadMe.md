# Bake-Off 2
** The goal of this Bake Off was to integrate Human-Artificial Intelligence interaction **

## Project Title:
### Explainable CamIoT
## Project Team : Amirali Omidfar, Hannaneh Hojaiji, Haisong Lin

###  What are you trying to do in your project? What kind of AI is involved? How is it interactive with users? What domain-specific problems does it solve?
*** Our goal is to improve camIoT behavior in three different phase :***
1. Triggering mechanism
2. Object deteciton 
3. Finger control

### What is your proposed approach? Describe the planned system architecture, algorithms etc. Take as much space as needed, and include figures if necessary.
*** We are aiming to use to rule extraction in modeling the behavior of user performed triggering mechanism and give feedback in such way that user would improve his/her triggering action in later rounds.


For more information please refer to our mid-term presentation, which you may find here: [explainale CamIoT midter presentation](https://github.com/Amir-Omidfar/m209As/blob/master/bakeOff2/Bake%20off%202.pptx.pdf)


#### Things to keep in mind while training the server:
    1. Data file format should be.csv
    2. First row should be the titles, first row first column is "Class" and the remaining columns of the first row are xi,yi,zi i being from 1-42
    3.

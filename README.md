### Below is the description of how we approach this assignment:

1. The [leap motion sensor](https://www.leapmotion.com) is used for counting the number of fingers exrtended in the user's left/right hand.(We are using numbers 0 through 5)
2. Each 4-5 letters are grouped under the detected numbers 0-5. We use buttons to toggle through and pick the right letter.
